```scala
class MyClass(val x: Int) {
  def this() = this(0)
  override def toString(): String = x.toString
}

object Main extends App {
  val myInstance = new MyClass()
  println(myInstance.x) // this prints 0 as expected

  val myInstance2 = new MyClass(5)
  println(myInstance2.x) // this prints 5 as expected

  //Here is the corrected part
  val list = List(new MyClass(), new MyClass(1))

  list.foreach(println) // this will now print 0 and 1 as expected
}
```
